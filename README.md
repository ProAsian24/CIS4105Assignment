A version/source control system acts as a growth chart for a project. It allows contributors to stay p to date with each other's changes when adding new improvements and features. It is important to have that system because it is critical when collaborating on projects where many people will update the same code. It's always important to track your or other's changes and very crucial to keep records of the work being done. While working on code for a piece of software or a whole block of software, it is important to use the version/source control to audit each other's work and improve skills as a development team.
